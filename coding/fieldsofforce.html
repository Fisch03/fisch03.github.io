<h4>Fields of Force</h4>
<p>
  Fields of Force is a short platformer I made together with <a href="http://samyocord.me">Samyocord</a> for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020">GMTK Game Jam 2020</a>.
  It features Force-Fields similar to the dream blocks found in Celeste, which you have to use to avoid Spikes and other Obstacles.
  The Game is quite buggy and short in is current state, but we plan to expand on it in the future.
