<h4>floatingpoints</h4>
<p>
  floatingpoints is still a work in progress. The project has been suspended for now because I currently don't have the time to continue work on it.
  floatingpoints will be a coding game. You play as a drone infiltrating networks of computers.
</p>
<p>
  As the drone, you can see inside those computers and modify the code they are running.
  By doing this, you can affect doors, cameras and other equipment in the network.
</p>
<p>
  You can see the current progress of development in <a href="https://github.com/Fisch03/floatingpoints">this</a> GitHub repository.
