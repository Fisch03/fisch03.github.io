  <h4>NaOS</h4>
  <p>
  People around you keep arguing over which OS is the best? None of the top Operating systems suits your needs? You hate Computers?<br>
  NaOS (Not an Operating System) gets rid of all the trouble conventional OSes give you. No more Software incompatibilities, long boot times or people complaining about you not using Arch.
  </p>
  <p>
  Statistics show that 95% of people using NaOS are more successful in life than users of any other OS (seriously, fuck the other 5%).
  We've removed as much bloat as possible to save Space and make NaOS run faster. No more Cortana/Siri telling you unfunny jokes and no preinstalled Candy Crush. In fact, we even went so far as to remove all the useful stuff. This means NaOS fits on a Floppy and runs as smooth as butter, even on a literal potato.
