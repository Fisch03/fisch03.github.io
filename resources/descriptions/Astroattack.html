<h4>Astroattack</h4>
<p>
  Astroattack is a Gameboy game I made for a friend at the end of 2018.
</p>
<p>
  It is coded completely in z80 Assembly and would theoretically run on a real Gameboy.
  In the game, your player has to dodge falling asteroids and rockets. A dash and bombs to clear the whole screen make your life a little easier.
  Coding this was extremely challenging because of the limited power of a Gameboy and the size a game can have (32kb for code, graphics and music!)
