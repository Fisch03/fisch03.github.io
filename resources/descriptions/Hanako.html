<h4>Hanako</h4>
<p>
  Hanako is a Discord bot that started as a one-man-project by me in 2018.
  At first, the bot was just called "fischisdiscordbot" but shortly after <a href="http://samyocord.me">Samyocord</a> joined me in development at the end of 2019,
  we renamed the bot to "Hanako". This rebranding also included an almost complete overhaul of the bot's code to make it much more organized and development-friendly.
  At the beginning of February 2020, <a href="https://github.com/yrezar">Yrezar</a> also joined our dev team.

<p>
  The bot is currently being hosted on <a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a>, and you can <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=481431288180637707&permissions=518208&scope=bot" target="_blank">invite it to your Discord server with this link</a>.
  If you want to see the code or even contribute to the development, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/Fisch03/Hanako-Discord">GitHub repository</a> or join the official <a href="https://discord.gg/8fGVDAs">Discord</a>.
